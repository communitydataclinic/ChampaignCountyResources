Most referrals to CRSA are from parents who call because their child has either been denied access to a needed plan of mental health care or their community does not have the necessary resources to stabilize their emotionally disturbed child. CRSA will find out where the system broke down, then, case by case, attempt to resolve the barrier.

CRSA is aware of issues relating to safety and mental health because 99% of youth served have an emotional disturbance, and out of those, 60% are youth with physical aggression problems. Close to 40% of referrals are about youth who are suicidal and over a quarter of the referrals are about youth who want to harm or kill others.

Whether CRSA is helping child by child or proposing systemic changes in the state service system, one thing is for certain, children and families in Illinois continue to need a ""safety net"" to fall back upon. The CRSA will most likely always have a role in our state.
